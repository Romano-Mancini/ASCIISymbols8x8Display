# ASCII Byte Matrix for 8x8 Displays

Welcome to the ASCII Byte Matrix repository for 8x8 displays!

## Introduction

This repository contains a comprehensive byte matrix specifically designed for 8x8 displays, covering all ASCII characters. Each character's byte representation is meticulously organized in ascending order of their ASCII values.

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project stemmed from the lack of satisfactory options available online. Frustrated by the limitations, I decided to create this byte matrix from scratch to ensure a reliable and comprehensive resource for developers working with 8x8 displays.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are highly encouraged and appreciated! If you have ideas for improvements, optimizations, or even suggestions to include Unicode characters in the future, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we can enhance the functionality and versatility of this byte matrix for a wider range of applications.
